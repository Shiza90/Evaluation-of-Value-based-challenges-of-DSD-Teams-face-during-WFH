This repository contains the supporting calculations and tables used in this research work. Title of the work is: Evaluation of Value-based challenges of DSD Teams face during WFH through VBSE and Bipolar fuzzy CRITIC CODAS Methodology

üîç Objective

To identify, evaluate, and rank critical challenges that affect productivity in DSD environments while WFH using a structured multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

- VBSE for systematic identification of value-critical challenges.
- Bipolar Fuzzy Logic to capture nuanced expert judgments.
- CRITIC to derive objective weights based on inter-criteria correlation.
- CODAS to rank challenges with consideration of both Euclidean and Taxicab distances.
